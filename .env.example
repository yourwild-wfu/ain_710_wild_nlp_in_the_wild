# Input Strings for Labs
TEST_TEXT="I love this new feature!"
# Note: Separate each text in BATCH_TEXTS with a semicolon (;)
# To allow semicolons inside a text, wrap each text in double quotes like: "text1";"text2"
# EDUCATIONAL NOTE: We use Regex in the code to handle "escaped" characters like \" or \\.
# If you need to put a quote inside a quoted string, use a backslash: \"
BATCH_TEXTS="\"I love the design, but the setup was frustrating.\";\"This was a complete waste of time.\";\"Absolutely fantastic experience — would recommend.\";\"Yeah, great… just what I needed (eye roll).\""

# Embedding Inputs
EMBEDDING_TEXTS="\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\";\"I love exploring natural language processing.\";\"Embeddings represent text as dense vectors of numbers.\""

# Prompts & Engineering
# Note: NARRATIVE_PROMPT contains variables in curly brackets (e.g., {total_processed}). 
# These are automatically filled by the app. If you are new to coding, do not remove them.
SENTIMENT_PROMPT="You are an NLP evaluator. Your job is to classify the sentiment of the user's text. Return ONLY a JSON object that matches the provided schema."
ENTITY_EXTRACTION_PROMPT="You are a helpful assistant that extracts entities (people, places, things) from text. Return only a comma-separated list of entities, or 'None' if none found."
NARRATIVE_PROMPT="You are an AI educator teaching a class about Natural Language Processing and Embeddings. Provide a concise narrative overview of the embedding run results: Total items: {total_processed}, Mean Magnitude: {mean_magnitude}, Entities: {entities_list}. Explain normalization and the significance of entities."
